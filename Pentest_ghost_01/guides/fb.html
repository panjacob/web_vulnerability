<h2>Forced Browsing</h2>
<p>
Forced Browsing is a very simple technique commonly called dot slash. This type of access is capable by mis-configured servers that allow file searching through the browser. Here is a quick example:<br />
original address - http://www.mysite.com/index.php<br />
Forced Browse - http://www.mysite.com/../../../../../the file you want to access/<br />
URL Encoded - http://www.mysite.com/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fthe file you want to access/<br /><br />
For more information and further tutorials on using ../ there is a site that i have used many time you can find it <a href="http://www.hellboundhackers.org">Here</a>. This site has many hacker challenges to test your skills.
