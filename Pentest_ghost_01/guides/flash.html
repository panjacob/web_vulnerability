<h2>Flash Parameter Injection</h2>
<p>
Flash is found all over the web. There are many different ways to inject code into flash parameters, and many different ways to use each of them. I will not go into all of the different injection types but here are a few.<br />
<b>Injection through Html with Xss -</b>mymovie.swf?vulnerableVariable=javascript: alert('Xss Test')<br />
<b>Injection through swf loading as parameter through DOM -</b> http://vulnerableFlash.com#&glVar=javascript: alert('xss')<br /><br />
For other references about FPI please do further research there are many good examples on the OWASP website <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Flash_Security_Project">Here</a>, along with what the vulnerable code looks like.
