<h2>Code Injection and Session Hijacking</h2>
<p>Code injection can be performed many different ways one of my favorite is through mis-configured server that allow URL file access. Code can be injected this way through the use of RFI which i cover in a different document. One of the most basic ways that code injection can be used is through cookie tampering. As shown in this site, cookie tampering is very easy to perform and even easier to perform authentication forgery. The way this site is set up is different from real world examples in the aspect that most cookies are encoded or use random session id's to try and prevent this action. There are tools that you can find online to help try and guess the users next authentication number. Along with cookie tampering and cookie stealing comes session hijacking. Session hijacking is again pretty easy to perform, someone clicks a link the attacker posts and their credentials are stolen. In essence clickjacking is performed the same way, someone clicks a link they are redirected to a page that can steal their credentials, inject their computer with malware, a backdoor, or possibly even command injection.</p>
